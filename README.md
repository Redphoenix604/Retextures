# Retextures
 Retextures Ive made, and are not being used anymore
 Over 150 different retextures. They were used on the Psycho Gaming Server, which is why the name says PsychoClothes. Personal items have been taken out.
 
## There is some "Hoarder Gear", Lots of slots for attachments and for items.
## A bunch of random colored ghillies with matching wraps. Ghillies have extra slots aswell as being on the armband slot.
## Random t-shirts, pants, jackets, and camo clothes.
## Pop cans, and a barrel.
 
 Types,TraderConfig included. May be missing some, not much though.
 
 Resign the Pbo, and throw into your server!
